# PMCS PRO

## COMP-296 (Advanced Software Project)

PMCS Pro was a website I built using reactjs. The goal of the website was to expidite the process
of performing a PMCS or (Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services) that the Military requires
soldiers to perform on vehicles / heavy machinery on either a weekly or monthly basis. The website
was linked to a local SQL database that would store pertinent information to each PMCSable item,
soldiers would then be able to use that data to fill out a DD(2404)"Equipment Inspection and Maintenance
Worksheet" faster than compared to if they had to pull all the information off the item itself. 

Ideas I had for the website but was not able to implement because of time constraints and other 
class loads include but are not limited to. <br>
