# PMCS PRO

## COMP-296 (Advanced Software Project)

PMCS Pro was a website I built using react js. The goal of the website was to expidite the process
of performing a PMCS or (Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services) that the Military requires
soldiers to perform on vehicles / heavy machinery on either a weekly or monthly basis. The website
was linked to a local SQL database that would store pertinent information to each PMCSable item,
soldiers would then be able to use that data to fill out a DD(2404)"Equipment Inspection and Maintenance
Worksheet" faster than compared to if they had to pull all the information off the item itself. <br>

**Big thanks to user techmoro's  for his "React Multi Page Website" code, which I used as a template** <br>
[techmoro's React Multi Page Website](https://pages.github.com/) <br>

Ideas I had for the website but was not able to implement because of time constraints and other 
class loads include but are not limited to. <br>
<br>
• A scanned DD (2404) that soldiers could fill out and print from the website. <br>
• Printable documents.<br>
• Item linkage and update history for all users. <br>
• Automated email system. <br>
• Image storage. <br>
